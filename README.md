### Strategy Pattern
> The Strategy Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a family of interchangeable algorithms or behaviors and makes them interchangeable at runtime. It allows you to define a set of algorithms, encapsulate each one of them, and make them interchangeable without altering the client code that uses these algorithms. This pattern promotes the "open-closed principle" of object-oriented design, which means that you can add new algorithms without modifying existing code.
